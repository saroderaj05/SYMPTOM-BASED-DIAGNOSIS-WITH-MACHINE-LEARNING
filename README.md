# Disease Detective: Symptom-Based Diagnosis with Machine Learning

## Overview

This repository is home to the Disease Prediction Machine Learning Project, designed to utilize symptom data to accurately predict diseases. By applying sophisticated machine learning algorithms, this project aims to aid in early diagnosis and improve healthcare outcomes.

## Project Highlights

**Data Preprocessing Excellence**: We employed advanced preprocessing techniques, such as feature scaling and encoding, to ensure high-quality data input for model training.

**Diverse Algorithm Implementation**: The project harnesses a variety of machine learning algorithms, including Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forests, and XGBoost, to predict diseases from symptoms with high accuracy.

**Model Accuracy and Performance**: Our models have been fine-tuned to achieve significant accuracy, with the XGBoost model achieving an impressive 89% accuracy rate, offering reliable predictions that can support medical professionals.

**Real-world Application**: The insights and predictive power provided by this project have the potential to be incorporated into healthcare systems for enhanced diagnostic support.
